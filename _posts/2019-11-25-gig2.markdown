Thought you'd get away with just one gig and one trip this term? Oh no no no! We have much more in store for you, RocSoc...
Yes, that's right, our second gig of the term!

Featuring:
Indie Rock 5-piece Seprona! 
Lancaster Power-pop/Rock/Indie 6-piece Sidley Park!

Quite the lineup, RocSoc! 

Now don't you worry, we're retaining our member discount for entry! Members will be paying just Â£1 per band!
