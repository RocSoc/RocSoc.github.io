Whatever type of rock, punk or metal music you like, we have something for you - from classic rock to prog, pop-punk to grunge, thrash metal to alt rock, industrial to rock and roll - we have it all.

We're a friendly society who meet every week in term time for socials(every Monday evening from 8.30-11:30). We're open minded and welcome all, whether you're a big music fan or just curious about rock and metal. We have our own DJs who play your requests, whether you've asked for them before the social or just fancy them on the night!

Term 1 is almost upon us, and we are ready to reveal RocSoc's membership benefits for the 2020/2021 year!
We are happy to announce that we have a new sponsor this year, The Pub!

They have generously offered to be our host for this years socials at their venue on China Street!

With a RocSoc membership, you will be entitled to:
 * 15% off of all Draught beer, lager, cider and soft drinks at The Pub!
 * 1 x FREE RocSoc/The Pub branded T-shirt!
 * A discount on all ticketed live RocSoc Gigs hosted in The Pub's Function Room!
 * A discount on all RocSoc trips!
 * Access to the fully catered end of Academic year BBQ, hosted in The Pub's new beer garden! (veggie options available!)
 * Bragging rights!
 
All this for Â£4 per annual membership!
Membership should be available for purchase following the digital freshers fair taking place on 2nd October. 
RocSoc usually aims to host 10 socials, 2 gigs and 1 trip per term. Unfortunatley, 'The Virusâ„¢' has thrown a spanner into the works.

What this means is that NO ROCSOC FACE TO FACE events can take place in the michaelmas term (so says LUSU.)
H O W E V E R:
* RocSoc will be continuing its current weekly scheduled  Discord calls (featuring a 'pub' quiz, a robot DJ and the ability to chat with fellow members without fear of being coughed on.) These calls are currently every Monday at 8:30pm-Late.
* Your Drinks discount at The Pub will still be valid in term 1 even if no official RocSoc events can take place.
* An abscence of face to face events in term 1 means that (circumstances permitting) term 2 will be more  D E N S E L Y  packed with fun stuff.

Please note that Government and University Restrictions are subject to change ( but you already knew that ðŸ™ƒ )
