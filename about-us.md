Whatever type of rock, punk or metal music you like, we have something for you - from classic rock to prog, pop-punk to grunge, thrash metal to alt rock, industrial to rock and roll - we have it all.

We're a friendly society who meet every week in term time for socials(every Monday evening from 8.30-11:30). We're open minded and welcome all, whether you're a big music fan or just curious about rock and metal. We have our own DJs who play your requests, whether you've asked for them before the social or just fancy them on the night!

Official membership of the society for a year will set you back £5 when you pay at Freshers Fair or £6 any other time. A RocSoc membership also gives you reduced local gigs, and £2.50 house doubles at our venue (right next to sugarhouse) We also have themed socials and big nights out! If you want to come give us a try before you sign up, that's fine too!
